    <!-- 1. What is website ? -->
    <!-- 
        A website is a collection of web pages that are accessible through the internet. It is like a digital space or location where individuals, businesses, or organizations can share information, provide services, or interact with others.

        Think of a website as a virtual storefront or an online brochure. Just like a physical store or a brochure provides information or sells products, a website does the same but in a digital format. It allows people to navigate through different pages that are interconnected, usually accessed through links or menus.

        Each web page within a website can contain various types of content, such as text, images, videos, forms, and interactive elements. These pages can be organized and designed in a way that makes it easy for visitors to find the information they are looking for.

        A website can serve different purposes. It can be used to showcase products or services, provide information, share news or articles, offer online shopping, facilitate communication, or even provide entertainment. Websites can be static, with fixed content that rarely changes, or dynamic, with regularly updated information or user-generated content.

        To access a website, you need a web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. By typing in the website's address or URL, you can visit the website and explore its pages and content.

    <!-- 2. What is Web Development? -->
    <!-- 
        Web Development refers to the process of creating websites and web applications that are accessible via the internet. It involves the design, development, and maintenance of websites, encompassing various aspects such as web design, client-side scripting, server-side scripting, database management, and network security.

        Web development typically involves a combination of programming languages, frameworks, and tools to build the different components of a website. Frontend development focuses on creating the user-facing interface, including the layout, design, and interactivity using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Backend development involves handling server-side logic, database management, and ensuring the functionality and security of the website.

    <!-- 3. what is Full Stack Development -->
    <!-- 
        Full Stack Web Development refers to the practice of building both the client-side (frontend) and server-side (backend) components of a web application. A Full Stack Web Developer is proficient in multiple programming languages, frameworks, and technologies necessary for developing both the user-facing interfaces and the underlying server infrastructure.

        In Full Stack Web Development, frontend development involves creating interactive and responsive user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This includes designing and implementing the visual elements, layout, and user interactions of a website or web application.

        On the backend, a Full Stack Web Developer handles server-side programming, database management, and server infrastructure setup. They use technologies such as Python, Node.js, Django, or Flask to handle server-side logic and communicate with databases. This involves processing data, handling user authentication, managing application state, and integrating with external services.

        A Full Stack Web Developer is responsible for understanding the entire web development stack, from the user interface to the server infrastructure. They are capable of seamlessly integrating frontend and backend components to create fully functional and dynamic web applications.
