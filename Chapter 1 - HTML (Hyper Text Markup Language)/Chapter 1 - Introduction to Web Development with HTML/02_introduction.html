        1. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
        2. It is a markup language used to structure and present content on the internet.
        3. With HTML, web developers create the building blocks of web pages, defining the structure, layout, and   elements of a website.

        4. HTML consists of a series of elements
        5. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
        

        HTML uses tags to mark up different elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. These tags define the purpose and formatting of each element, allowing web browsers to interpret and display the content correctly. HTML works hand-in-hand with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to control the visual appearance of web pages.

        By learning HTML, you gain the ability to create well-organized and semantically structured web pages. You can format text, add images, create lists, embed multimedia, and link different pages together. HTML is the language that enables websites to be interactive, accessible, and user-friendly.

        Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, HTML is an essential skill for anyone interested in web development. It forms the backbone of every website and provides the necessary structure for other technologies to build upon. With HTML, you have the power to shape the digital world and create engaging online experiences for users worldwide.
