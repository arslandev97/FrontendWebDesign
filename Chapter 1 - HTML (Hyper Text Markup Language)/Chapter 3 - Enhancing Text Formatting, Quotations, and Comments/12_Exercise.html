Sure! Here are a few exercises related to HTML quotation and citation elements:

<h2>Exercise 1:</h2>

<h2>Exercise 2:</h2>
<p>Create an HTML document with a paragraph containing a sentence that you believe is a meaningful quote. Wrap the quote in a q element to indicate that it is a short inline quotation. Provide a citation for the quote using the cite attribute of the q element.</p>



<h2>Exercise 3:</h2>
<p>Build an HTML document that showcases a long quotation. Use the blockquote element to enclose the quotation. Inside the blockquote, include multiple paragraphs of text from a famous speech or historical document. Use the cite attribute of the blockquote element to provide the source of the quotation.</p>


<h2>Exercise 4:</h2>
<p>Construct an HTML document with several quotations from different sources. Use the blockquote element for each quotation and provide a citation for each using the cite attribute. Experiment with styling the blockquotes differently using CSS to make them visually distinct.</p>
